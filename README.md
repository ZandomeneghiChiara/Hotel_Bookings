This is a project about Hotel Booking Demand for my Programming course: 

- Project_HotelBookingsDemand.ipynb: It is a Copy Colab file about the Project 
- hotel_bookings.csv: It is my Hotel Booking Demand Dataset
- clean_dataset.py: It is a clean dataset from Hotel Booking Demand Dataset in Python
- project_hotelbookingsdemand_streamlit.py: It is the Streamlit of the Project
- Project_HotelBookingsDemand_.ipynb: it is a Jupyter Notebook for Visual Studio

The Colab file is the one with all the comments and plots etc. The reasoning behind the cleaning is not in the clean_dataset.py file, but in the Colab one. I used it to import the clean dataframe directly in the Streamlit e Jupyter file (so that the code could be clearer, focusing only on the plots and models)
